TypeScript supports the concept of modules , It can export / Import classes , functions , variables etc.

We can write codes in different modules and export or import based on the requirement.

For example

Driver.ts class wants to use customer.ts class, so in this case the customer.ts will export and driver.ts will import from customer.ts class.

Customer.ts

export class Customer{}

Driver.ts

import {Customer} from './Customer';  {ClassName } and ['FileNameWithoutExtension']
